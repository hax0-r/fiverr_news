                <p class="text-[#333333]">In Malaysia, waiting for a doctor’s appointment is a common source of
                    frustration. Clinics and
                    hospitals are often bogged down by unpredictable schedules—doctors running late, unscheduled
                    emergencies, and patients showing up early or not at all. For years, queue management systems have
                    been introduced to address this issue, but they’ve all fallen short. The reason? They rely on a
                    level of punctuality that rarely exists in real-world healthcare environments.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s where Chup Online, a Malaysian-based Dynamic Queue Management and Appointment Automation
                    system, has stepped in. Instead of trying to force patients and doctors into rigid time slots, Chup
                    Online adjusts to reality—it adapts to delays, emergencies, and unpredictability, all while keeping
                    patients informed. It’s not about fixing the queue but about fixing the communication gap.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-[#333333] font-bold text-xl my-7">The Simple Solution: Just Keep Patients Informed</h2>
                <p class="text-[#333333]">Patients don’t necessarily mind delays; they mind not knowing. This is the
                    core problem Chup Online solves. With their system, patients are notified one hour before their
                    scheduled appointment if their doctor is running late. Instead of arriving at a hospital and wasting
                    hours in the waiting room, patients can adjust their arrival time based on real-time updates
                    delivered via WhatsApp or SMS. “Patients don’t need miracles; they just need to know when to show
                    up,” says Nik Abbas, Chief Product Officer at Chup Online. The system allows healthcare providers to
                    keep patients informed without adding extra work for staff. Instead of having nurses or
                    administrative staff manually call hundreds of patients to rearrange their appointments, Chup Online
                    automates the entire process.</p>
                <h2 class="text-[#333333] font-bold text-xl my-7">Why Other Systems Don’t Work?</h2>
                <p class="text-[#333333]">The failure of traditional systems in Malaysia boils down to one thing: they
                    assume everyone is on time. But doctors frequently need to take unscheduled breaks for surgeries or
                    consultations, throwing the entire day’s schedule off course. Meanwhile, patients are left in the
                    dark, unsure of when—or if—they’ll be seen. Chup Online’s Dynamic Queue Management and Appointment
                    Automation changes the game. When a doctor is delayed for any reason, the system automatically
                    reschedules the rest of the day’s appointments and informs patients accordingly. It’s an elegant
                    solution to a messy problem.</p>
                <img src="/Docs/assets/Techcrunch-Images/img2.png" class="w-full my-7 rounded-sm" alt="">
                <h2 class="text-[#333333] font-bold text-xl my-7">Behind the Scenes: A Complex Solution to a Simple
                    Problem</h2>
                <p class="text-[#333333]">While Dynamic Queue Management sounds straightforward in theory, executing it
                    at the scale of a busy hospital is anything but simple. The system not only has to account for
                    clinic closing times, patient consent, and clashes with walk-ins, but also manage the complexity of
                    no-shows and patients who are already on-site. But that’s just scratching the surface.
                    Chup Online had to tackle an even more intricate challenge: the bottlenecks at every station
                    patients pass through before even seeing a doctor. This includes registration, triage, blood tests,
                    billing, pharmacy, and even the insurance counter. The system ensures patients arrive just in time
                    to meet their doctor and can seamlessly transition from one station to the next.
                    <br><br>
                    To achieve this, Chup Online didn’t just focus on queue management—it had to automate the entire
                    patient process at every station. This required developing features that hospitals’ Hospital
                    Information Systems (HIS) should have had, ensuring that every interaction—whether it’s processing a
                    test or completing a payment—was optimized for speed and efficiency. The goal? To make sure the
                    patient’s journey is as fast and smooth as possible, from start to finish. This level of integration
                    took years of real-world testing, multiple iterations, and fine-tuning algorithms to accommodate
                    every delay, emergency, and bottleneck in a hospital’s daily operations.

                <h2 class="text-[#333333] font-bold text-xl my-7">Results: 2-Hour Wait Times Reduced to 15 Minutes</h2>
                <p class="text-[#333333]">
                    At UKM Specialist Centre, a private hospital where Chup Online was piloted, the results were
                    significant. Average patient wait times dropped from almost two hours to just 15 minutes. Over
                    92.34% of patients reported being highly satisfied with the system, particularly appreciating the
                    real-time updates that allowed them to arrive exactly when needed. Now, Chup Online is conducting a
                    pilot project with Malaysia’s Ministry of Health, and the results have been equally promising. While
                    not every patient can be “rescued”—especially in last-minute emergencies—the vast majority now spend
                    far less time in waiting rooms. With the company’s plan to roll out nationwide to over 3,000 clinics
                    and 150 hospitals, Chup Online is poised to become one of the nation’s most-used apps after the
                    pilot project.

                <h2 class="text-[#333333] font-bold text-xl my-7">Why No One Else Tackles This Problem?</h2>
                <p class="text-[#333333]">Most companies don’t want to touch this problem because it takes too much time
                    and investment to solve properly. Building a Dynamic Queue Management and Appointment Automation
                    system that functions in real time is complex, requiring massive investment. Other systems focus on
                    simpler, easier-to-implement features. But Chup Online recognized this was a pain point worth
                    addressing. “Other systems don’t want to invest years in fixing this one problem. We did, and it’s
                    starting to pay off,” says Nik Abbas.</p>
                <h2 class="text-[#333333] font-bold text-xl my-7">The Future: Expanding Beyond Healthcare</h2>
                <p class="text-[#333333]">Having proven its effectiveness in Malaysia, Chup Online is now eyeing
                    expansion. The company plans to roll out its Dynamic Queue Management and Appointment Automation
                    system in Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, where similar healthcare punctuality issues
                    persist. But the solution isn’t limited to healthcare alone. Chup Online can also be applied to
                    other public services such as immigration, road tax, and other government departments, as well as
                    private services like in-person banking, restaurants, salons, spas, and workshops—anywhere waiting
                    times and unpredictability create friction. As Southeast Asia’s healthcare systems and public
                    services continue to expand, Chup Online’s real-time, patient- and customer-centric approach could
                    be exactly what the region needs.</p>
                <h2 class="text-[#333333] font-bold text-xl my-7">The Mission: A World with No On-Premise Waits</h2>
                <p class="text-[#333333]">Chup Online’s mission is simple: a world with no on-premise waits anymore. The
                    algorithm is designed to handle any situation. Whether booking a healthcare appointment, visiting a
                    restaurant, or going to the bank, Chup Online makes sure you don’t have to wait. In Malay slang,
                    “Chup” means “to book it”, and with Chup Online, once you “Chup it,” there’s no need to wait.</p>
